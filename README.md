# ChatApp
An anonymous chatting app where anyone can join chat room and message anyone. All you require is an username and you are good to go.

The app uses Firebase as a backend and works on Real-time database of Firebase.

This app was created as a simple starting project for me to learn `react-native` so UI of this app may not be good.

# Modules
Although dependencies can be found in `package.json`. I'm listing their names and their uses.

- `react-native` - Duh!
- `react-native-firebase/app` - For authorizing app with firebase console.
- `react-native-firebase/database` - For connecting to real time database of firebase.
- `react-native-gifted-chat` - For chat screen


There are other dependencies also, but they are only  required by these modules to work.

# Todo

This app was made for practice purpose only. Thats why it is at bare minimum. There are many things can be added like :

- [ ] Make UI better
- [ ] Add password authentication
- [ ] Enable protection of chatrooms
- [ ] Customize chat screen

I may not be able to add these features. If you are interested in completing these features please open a PR.
